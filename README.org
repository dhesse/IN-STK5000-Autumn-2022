 - What is data-based decision making?
 - Why data-based decision making?
   - Industry perspective
     - What is digitalization?
       - Some examples
     - Why do we talk about digitalization now?
   - Three vs of big data
 - Methods for data-based deciion making
   - Machine learning
   - Alternatives to machine learning
 - Limitations and challenges
   - Model interpretability/explainability
   - Privacy
   - Fairness
   - Scarcity or abundance of data

** Topics

*** Introduction

*** Tools of the trade - Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Tensorflow

The aim here is merely to get everyone on the same page. ~2-3
lectures.

- Python - Data Science's favourite programming language
- Jupyter - Notebooks
- Scikit-learn - Industry Standard Machine Learning Package
- Pandas - Industry Standard Data Analysis
- Tensorflow - Accelerated Neural Networks and Bayesian Modeling


*** Beyond Machine Learning - Decision Making

- Confidence intervals, uncertainty
- Bayesian models
- Reliability and reproducibility
- Multi-armed bandits (?)

*** Outliers, Data Contamination, Fraud Detection

- Basic definitions, what is an outlier and how to identify them
  - In particular, what makes estimating tails of a distribution hard?
- Reasons for the presence or absence of outliers
- Advanced methods for outlier detection
  - Such as clustering + outlier detection, autoencoders
  - Benford's Law, fraud detection

*** 'Big data' Tools: Apache Spark, Apache Airflow 

- Why do we need specific tools for large data sets?
  - What is a large data set?
- How do those tools deal with large data sets?
  - Example: Map Reduce
- Apache Spark - Big Data Machine Learning
- Apache Airflow - Model
  
*** Challenges

- Model interpretability/explainability
- Privacy
- Fairness
- Scarcity or abundance of data
