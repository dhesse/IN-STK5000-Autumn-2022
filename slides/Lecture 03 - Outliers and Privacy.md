# Session 06

## Outliers (finishing up) and privacy in action

---

# Outliers

- We'll be looking at outliers in the bysykkel data. 
- We'll be looking for a appropriate distribution to model trip

## Log-normal distribution

Reminder: If $X$ is normal distributed, then

$$Y = \operatorname{log}(X)$$

is lognormal-distributed.

---

## Chi-square distribution

Reminder: If $Z_i, i = 1,\ldots,k$ are normal distributed, then

$$Y = \sum_i X_i$$

is $\chi^2$ distributed.

Not normally used to model observations, but for hypothesis testing
and confidence intervals.

# Privacy: Randomization

## $\epsilon$-differential privacy
